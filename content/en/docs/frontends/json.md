  The JSON API is the most basic API for Rhyme. It is a simple JSON-based API where users can express Rhyme queries using JSON.

Before diving into different kinds of operators, we will first look the steps involved in running a Rhyme query.
We assume that you have already installed the `rhyme-lang` package in your project.
If not, please head out to the [installation](/docs/getting-started#installation) page.

Rhyme works by compiling the given query into a function that can be run on data.
The compilation step is done by the `api.compile` function.
This returns a JS function which can be run on any input data to get the result of the query.

```js
// import the library
let api = require("rhyme-lang")

// define the query
let query = {
    "data.*.key": api.sum("data.*.value")
}

// use the api.compile function to compile the query
let func = api.compile(query)

// run the compiled function on some sample data
let sampleData = [
        { key: "A", value: 10 },
        { key: "B", value: 20 },
        { key: "A", value: 30 }
    ]
let result = func({"data": sampleData})
```

Now that we have seen the basic steps involved in running a Rhyme query, let us look at the different kinds of operators available in Rhyme.

### Simple Indexing
Like JQ, we can use the `.` operator to index into objects and arrays. For instance the query `data.0` will return the first element of the array `data`.


### Iterating
We can use the `*` operator to iterate over arrays and compute aggregations. For instance, the query `data.*.value` will
iterate through `data` and collect all the `value` attributes.

```js
["data.*.value"] // collect all the values
```

Note that if no top-level aggregation is specified explicitly, the first value is returned. 
For instance, the query `data.*.value` will return `10` for the sample data above.

We will see later that these iterators can be named like `*A`, `*B`, `*item`, etc. instead of using the default `*` symbol
to allow for more complex queries.

### Aggregations

We can use aggregate operators to compute aggregations over iterated values.
For instance, the query `api.sum(data.*.value)` will compute the sum of all the values.
Below is a list of all the aggregate operators currently available in Rhyme.

| Aggregation | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `api.sum` | Computes the sum of the values |
| `api.min` | Computes the minimum of the values |
| `api.max` | Computes the maximum of the values |
| `api.mean` | Computes the mean of the values |
| `api.count` | Computes the number of values |
| `api.array` or `[ ]` | Collects all the values into an array |

### Arithmetic (Binary Operators)
Rhyme supports the usual basic arithmetic operations like, addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

| Opeartor | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `api.plus` | Addition |
| `api.minus` | Subtraction |
| `api.mul` | Multiplication |
| `api.div` | Division |
| `api.fdiv` | Floor division |
| `api.mod` | Modulo |

### Group-bys
Group-bys in Rhyme are implicitly expressed using keys. For instance, having `data.*.key` as the key would do
a group-by on the `key` attribute of the data and whenever `data.*` is iterated within this key, it will only
iterate over the values that have the same key.
We can use nested JSON objects to express group-bys on multiple keys.
For instance, the query below will do a group-by on the `key1` and `key2` attributes of the data.

```js
{
  "data.*.key1": {
    "data.*.key2": api.sum("data.*.value")
  }
}
```

### Joins
Rhyme currently only support equi-joins. Joins between two objects are essentially expressed as doing a 
lookup on the other object based on the key.
The following query will do a join between `data1` and `data2` based on the `key` attribute and compute
the sum of products of the `value` attributes.
`api.keyval` is used to specify expression as keys since JSON only supports string keys.

```js
{
  "-": api.keyval(api.get("data2", "data1.*.key")) (
    api.sum(api.times("data2.*.value", "data1.*.value"))
  )
}
```

### UDFs
Rhyme supports user-defined functions (UDFs) which can be used to express custom computations.
UDFs are expressed as using normal JS functions and called using `api.apply`.
For instance, the following query will apply the `multiply10` function to all the values in `data.*.value`.

```js
let udf = {
  multiply10: x => x * 10
}
let query = api.apply("multiply10", "data.*.value")
```
